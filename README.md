# Password Generator 
## Description
For my class project/homework, I was asked to create a webpage that creates a secured password. Through the things that were taught in my classes and resourcing through google, here is my final product.
## Functiionality
When laoded, the page will prompt you to choose character length of between 8 and 128 characters. Then it will confirm which types of characters you want to us. The choices are numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and symbols. Based off those prompt, when you click 'Generate Password', your random secure password will appear in the input box. Clicking Copy button will copy the password to your clipboard.
